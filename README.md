# Comparative_genomics_of_virulence_factors
In this repository, you will find some scripts and commands to perform specific comparative genomics analysis

This guide is divided in five stages:

1.- Evolution of pathogenicity through virulence factors.

2.- TTSS in Gammaproteobacteria.

3.- Genomic and pathogenic islands.

4.- Antibiotic resistance.

5.- Mobile elements and phages.


Each stage shows how to perform some analysis to answer specific questions.
