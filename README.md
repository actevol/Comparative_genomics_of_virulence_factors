# Comparative_genomics_of_virulence_factors
In this repository, you will find some scripts and commands to perform specific comparative genomics analysis

This guide is divided in five stages:

1.- [Evolution of pathogenicity through virulence factors.](https://github.com/actevol/Comparative_genomics_of_virulence_factors/blob/master/Stage01.Rmd)

2.- [Secretion systems in Gammaproteobacteria.](https://github.com/actevol/Comparative_genomics_of_virulence_factors/blob/master/Stage02.Rmd)

3.- [Mobile elements.](https://github.com/actevol/Comparative_genomics_of_virulence_factors/blob/master/Stage03.Rmd)

4.- [Antibiotic resistance.](https://github.com/actevol/Comparative_genomics_of_virulence_factors/blob/master/Stage04.Rmd)


Each stage shows how to perform some analysis to answer specific questions.
